###### Holidaze: Project Exam 2

### Introduction
Welcome to Holidaze, the final project for my Front-End Development studies at Noroff! This application is an Airbnb-inspired platform designed to simplify venue management and bookings for travelers and venue managers alike. Holidaze offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, built with modern front-end technologies, to enhance the experience of both travelers and hosts.
